        <div class="subheading mb-5">English MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">A driven and ambitious current college student with excellent time management and organizational skills. With past experience of writing professionally, organizing and creating events, promoting and publicizing for a company (Arcadia Stage Company), and digital advertisements for said company. Seeking to further my skills and provide the ability to problem solve, collaborate, and flourish in any given work environment or situation. 
Past education includes being a 2022 graduate from Arcadia High School with a 3.8 GPA while also being involved in clubs and AP classes. Currently a student at University of California, Riverside as a first year, furthering my experience and majoring in English to get my Bachelorâ€™s Degree. 
<br><br>

        	I have experience of being both a publicist and historian for a company throughout highschool. My experience with being an officer with the titles of publicist and historian covers several bases. Including the ability to create and edit promotion videos along with digital advertisements such as posters or flyers. Was also in charge of all social media accounts for the company and promoted on each social media frequently with new material created by myself. Expanded follower-ship and social media outreach for the company to further our sales to more customers. Along with the experience of promotion and social media/digital marketing, I also have the experience and ability to organize and create events for the company such as bonding events for those within the company, putting on a small scale show which brought in profit, and more. Along with said experience, I also have experience with writing professionally. Having written plays, short films and produced/edited said short films, stories, poetry, and more that have been entered into competitions and won or published onto the internet. All the skills stated above have helped further my knowledge to further my career. 
<br><br>

        I currently also hold many additional skills and traits such as leadership abilities, social media knowledge, organization and cleanliness, attention to detail, strong written and verbal communication, personable, and creative. Continuously learning and growing to further experience and accomplish any work given to me. 
	My motivation to continue learning and working to adapt to all work environments and situations continues. Seeking to fulfill positions in need of my determination, loyalty, and hard-work.
